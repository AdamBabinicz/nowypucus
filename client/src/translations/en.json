    "faq1Question": "What is the drying time after carpet or upholstery cleaning?",
    "faq1Answer": "Drying time depends on many factors, such as the type of material, the thickness of the carpet or upholstery, air temperature and humidity. Usually, a carpet dries from 6 to 12 hours, and upholstery from 2 to 6 hours. Thanks to the use of modern extraction devices that draw out most of the moisture, the drying time is much shorter than with traditional cleaning methods.",
    "faq2Question": "Do you remove all types of stains?",
    "faq2Answer": "We can completely remove or significantly reduce the visibility of most popular stains. The effectiveness of stain removal depends on many factors: the type of stain, the time that has elapsed since its formation, the type of material and previous cleaning attempts. Some stains (e.g. paints, dyes, rust) may be difficult or impossible to completely remove. We always inform the customer about the possibilities before starting work.",
    "faq3Question": "Can you stay in the apartment during cleaning?",
    "faq3Answer": "Yes, you can stay in the apartment during the service. We use safe, professional cleaning agents that do not emit harmful fumes. However, we recommend that you limit the use of cleaned furniture and rooms during the drying time to speed up the drying process and avoid re-soiling.",
    "faq4Question": "Do you provide a free quote?",
    "faq4Answer": "Yes, we offer a free quote for services. We can make a quote by phone or email based on the information and photos provided. For more complicated orders, we come to the site to make an accurate assessment and propose the best solution."

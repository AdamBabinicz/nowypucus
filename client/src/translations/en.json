    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "How long does it take for a carpet or upholstery to dry after cleaning?",
    "faq1Answer": "Drying time depends on many factors, such as the type of material, thickness of the carpet or upholstery, air temperature, and humidity. Typically, a carpet dries in 6 to 12 hours, and upholstery in 2 to 6 hours. Thanks to modern extraction equipment that removes most of the moisture, drying time is significantly shorter than with traditional cleaning methods.",
    "faq2Question": "Do you remove all types of stains?",
    "faq2Answer": "We can completely remove most common stains or significantly reduce their visibility. The effectiveness of stain removal depends on many factors: the type of stain, the time since it occurred, the type of material, and previous cleaning attempts. Some stains (e.g., paint, dyes, rust) may be difficult or impossible to remove completely. We always inform the customer about the possibilities before starting work.",
    "faq3Question": "Can I stay in the apartment during cleaning?",
    "faq3Answer": "Yes, you can stay in the apartment while the service is being performed. We use safe, professional cleaning agents that do not emit harmful fumes. However, we recommend limiting the use of cleaned furniture and rooms during the drying time of carpets or upholstery to speed up the drying process and avoid re-soiling.",
    "faq4Question": "Do you provide a free quote?",
    "faq4Answer": "Yes, we offer a free service quote. We can provide a quote by phone or email based on the information and photos provided. For more complex orders, we come to the site to make an accurate assessment and propose the best solution."
